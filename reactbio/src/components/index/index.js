    My name is Oscar Nu√±ez, I was born in New York and moved to Miami at a young age.
    Having spent the later half of my life in Miami I've come to realize that the life style in New York is something that interest me.
    I graduated from Florida International University with a degree in psychology and criminal justice. 
    After graduation I started working as a specialist at Apple. Over the years of consistent hard work I was able to achieve the position of Genius. 
    Till this day I continue to apply myself and strive to be one of the top performers at my job.

    During my time of leisure I find myself enjoying a great local coffee shop, attending concerts, going on runs to the beach, and going to the gym. 
    Exploring different countries has been one of the best parts of my life. From cities like Berlin to Santorini it has been an exceptional opportunity to explore these places especially with my wife.
    My wife and I enjoy taking pictures of amazing landmarks, eating amazing local food and wine, and hanging out with the locals. 
    We truly immerse ourselves in the culture of any country we find ourselves in and we hope to continue to broaden our horizons.
